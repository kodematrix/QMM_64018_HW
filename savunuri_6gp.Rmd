Maximize Z = P - 6C - 3D

P = total (discounted) profit over the life of the new products,
C = change (in either direction) in the current level of employment,
D = decrease (if any) in next year's earnings from the current year's level.

Profit_Goal:
Max P = 20x1 +15x2 + 25x3
Emp_level goal:
6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 = 50   
Earning_next_year goal:
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 >=75 

Part 1) 
Model_Formulation:

y1 = 6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - 50   
y2 = 8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 -75 

Substitute the information into the original constraints

For employment level goal y1 = y1+ - y1-
y1+ - y1-= 6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - 50   

For the goal regarding earnings next year y2 = y2+ - y2-
y2+ - y2- = 8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 -75

Final Formulation
Max P = 20x1 +15x2 + 25x3
6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - (y1+ - y1-) = 50   
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - (y2+ - y2-) = 75
Xj >=0, yi + >=0, yi - >=0 

Part 2)

Objective Function:
Maximize Z = P - 6C - 3D

Objective function in terms of x1, x2, x3, y1+, y1- , y2+ and y2-
Maximize Z = 20x1 +15x2 + 25x3 - 6y1+ - 6y1- - 3y2- 

Part 3)
Objective Function:
max: 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 - 6y1m -6y1p - 3y2m;

Constraints:
Xj >=0, yi + >=0, yi - >=0 
6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - y1p + y1m = 50;
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - y2p + y2m = 75;
